**Java:**<br>
•	General purpose Programming language.<br>
•	Supports OOP<br>
•	Developed by Sun Microsystems of USA in 1991<br>
•	Called  as OAK by James Gosling <br>
•	Discovered to overcome the limitations of C and C++ in terms of both reliability & portability<br>
•	Thus, Java a really simple, reliable, portable & powerful language.<br>

(Add remaining versions)<br>


**Java Features:**<br>

1.	Compiled and Interpreted<br>
•	Computer language is either compiled or interpreted.<br>
•	Java combines 2 stage program<br>
i.	Compiler translates source code into bytecode.(Bytecod is not machine instruction, therefore 2nd stage)<br>
ii.	Interpreter generates machine code that directly executed by the machine i.e., running Java Program.<br>

2.	Platform Independent and Portable<br>
•	It can be moved from one computer system  to another , anywhere and anytime.<br>
•	Changes and upgrades in OS, processors and system resources will not force any changes in Java programs.<br>
•	This is the reason why Java has become more popular language for programming on Internet which connects different kinds of system world wide.<br>

3.	Object Oriented<br>
•	It is a true Object Oriented language.<br>
•	Almost everything in Java is Object.<br>
•	All program code reside in Object and Classes.<br>
•	It comes with an extensive set of Classes arranged in Packages.<br>
•	The Object model in Java is Simple and easy to extends.<br>

4.	Robust and Secure<br>
•	Robust - Java is a robust language.<br>
•	Provides many safeguards to ensure reliable code.<br>
•	Strict  Compile time and run time checking for data types.<br> 
•	Designed as Ggarbage collected language relieving memory management problems.<br>
•	Also incorporate Exception Handling to capture the series of errors and eliminates the risk of crashing the system.<br>
•	Security -  Issue when used with Internet. <br>
•	Fear for Threat of viruses and abuse of system,<br>
•	Java system verify all memory access, so that viruses communicated with an applet.<br>
•	Program cannot gain access to memory locations without proper authorization.<br>

5.	Distributed<br>
•	Designed as distributed language for creating applications on Network.<br>
•	It has ability to share both data and programs.<br>

6.	Simple, Small and Familiar<br>
•	Simple and Small- Many feature of C and C++ that are either redundant and unreliable code are not a part of Java.<br>
•	E.g., Pointers, Preprocessor headers, goto statements, Operator Overloading , Multiple Inheritance are eliminated.<br>
•	Familiarity -  To make the language familiar many features are modelled  on C/C++.<br>

7.	Multithreaded and Interactive<br>
•	Multithreaded- Multiple task simultaneously.<br>
•	No need to wait for the application to finish one task before beginning another.<br>
•	Java runtime comes with tools that support multiprocess synchronization and construct smoothly running interactive systeems.<br>

8.	High Performance<br>
•	Java performance is impressive for an interpreted language due to intermediate bytecode.<br>
•	Architecture is designed to reduce overheads during runtime.<br>

9.	Dynamic and Extensible<br>
•	It is capable of dynamic linking in new class libraries, methods and objects<br>
•	Native methods are linked dynamically at runtime.<br>

10.	Ease of Development<br>


*How java is Considered as Platform Independent and Portable ?*<br>
<br>
A. Java is considered as Portable because –<br>
Java is Considered as Platform independent because of many different reasons which are listed below -<br>
1.	Output of a Java compiler is Non Executable Code i.e Bytecode.<br>
2.	Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions<br>
3.	Bytecode is executed by Java run-time system, which is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br>
4.	JVM is an interpreter.<br>
5.	JVM accepts Bytecode as input and execute it.<br>
6.	Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run a program in a wide variety of environments because only the JVM needs to be implemented for each platform.<br>
7.	For a given System we have Run-time package , once JVM is installed for particular system then any java program can run on it.<br>
8.	However Internal details of  JVM will differ from platform to platform but still all understand the Same Java Bytecode.<br>
 

**Language Basics**<br>
*Variables*<br>
You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.<br><br>
*Operators*<br>
This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion includes code samples that you can compile and run.<br><br>
*Expressions, Statements, and Blocks*<br>
Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks. This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already seen.<br><br>
*Control Flow Statements*<br>
This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language. It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.<br>
